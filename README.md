This is my final project for my Object Oriented Computing Course. 

Project Name: Music Maker
Team Name: DJ Whale
Members: Luke Whaley

My project is a music making program that allows people to create their own songs. The user can set the BPM (beats per minute) of the song, create multiple instruments, and place notes within these different instruments. The user can also save and load their songs.

For info on how to use this program, read the User Manual.

Goal: I am trying to build a program that allows the user to make their own song. They can set the BPM (beats per minute) of the song, create multiple instruments, and place notes within these different instruments. The user will be able to play or stop their song at any point. The program will also allow the user to save and load their songs. I want to build this project because in my free time, I make my own music using a program called FL Studio. However, this program may be difficult for new users to learn. I want to create a simple and easy to use program that will help people learn the basics of music creation and inspire them to make songs of their own.

Estimated Effort: I plan to work on this project for around 5 hours per week over four weeks, which totals to 20 hours. Since I am passionate about music creation, I will put a significant amount of effort into coding this program.
