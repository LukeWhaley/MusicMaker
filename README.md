This is my final project for my Object Oriented Computing Course. 


Project Name: Music Maker
Team Name: DJ Whale
Members: Luke Whaley


My project, Music Maker, is a music making program that allows people to create their own songs. The user can set the BPM (beats per minute) of the song, create multiple instruments, and place notes within these different instruments. The user can also save and load their songs.
This program uses JavaFX to implement an interactive GUI.


How to Run the Program:
To run this program, ensure you have Java Development Kit (version 8 or higher) installed to your computer as well as a compatible Java IDE. Additionally, you must be able to run JavaFX on your device.
Open the project in a Java IDE and ensure that your file directories are correct in the launch.json and settings.json files.
Finally, compile and run MusicMaker.java to start making your own music!


When you open the program, you will see the Song View. You can save/load songs, change the BPM, set your instrument types, and play/stop the song. Clicking on an instrument will bring you to the note view, which will let you place notes for that instrument throughout the song. Pressing the back button will bring you back to the Song View.


For more detailed information on how to use the program, read the User Manual.
