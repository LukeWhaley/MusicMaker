This is my final project for my Object Oriented Computing Course. 

Project Name: Music Maker
Team Name: DJ Whale
Members: Luke Whaley

My project, Music Maker, is a music making program that allows people to create their own songs. The user can set the BPM (beats per minute) of the song, create multiple instruments, and place notes within these different instruments. The user can also save and load their songs.
This program uses JavaFX to implement an interactive GUI.

For info on how to use this program, read the User Manual.
